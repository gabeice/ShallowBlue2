# ShallowBlue

When you're playing chess, do you ever think to yourself, "Gol darn it! All these side effects I'm producing are giving me angst!"? If you do, then Shallowblue2 is just the game for you. Unlike the plain old object-oriented [Python version][shallow-blue] it's based on, ShallowBlue2 is written in 100% pure uncut 24 carat Haskell. That's right: 0 emission chess playing that's mathematically guaranteed to leave the world exactly the way it was when you started.
